## Specific Elements to Verify

### Charts with -3M Historical Data

#### Stock Projections Chart
```
Structure: -3M ---- T ---- 3M ---- 6M ---- 12M
           (hist) (now) (future projections)
```
- [ ] Historical line (-3M to T) renders solid blue
- [ ] Vertical yellow dashed "T" line at correct position
- [ ] Future line (T to 6M) solid opacity
- [ ] Future line (6M to 12M) fades into cone
- [ ] 5 data point circles at correct positions
- [ ] Circle at T has yellow outline
- [ ] Uncertainty cone starts at T and expands
- [ ] Gradient fills render correctly on all devices

#### Sector Projections Chart
```
Same structure but with 11 overlapping lines
```
- [ ] Historical segments visible for all sectors
- [ ] Only one "T" separator line (not 11!)
- [ ] Click-to-select works on all devices
- [ ] Selected sector shows uncertainty cone
- [ ] Non-selected sectors fade to low opacity
- [ ] Touch targets large enough on mobile (min 44px)

---

## Browser Testing

### Desktop Browsers
- [ ] Chrome (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Edge (latest)

### Mobile Browsers
- [ ] iOS Safari
- [ ] Chrome Mobile (Android)
- [ ] Samsung Internet

---

## Performance Checks

### Chart Rendering
- [ ] SVG renders in <1 second on mobile
- [ ] No janky scrolling with charts visible
- [ ] Smooth animations/transitions
- [ ] No memory leaks on page navigation

### Data Loading
- [ ] Loading states display properly
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] Network failures don't break layout

---

## Accessibility

- [ ] All charts have proper ARIA labels
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for interactive elements
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- [ ] Touch targets minimum 44x44px on mobile
- [ ] Focus indicators visible

---

## Known Issues / Notes

### Historical Data (-3M)
⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: The -3M historical data points are currently **simulated** (current score - 8).

Test results show significant discrepancies:
- AAPL: 14 points off
- TSLA: 36 points off  
- DVLT: 69 points off
- SPY: 12 points off

**Recommendation**: Update backend to return actual historical scores for accuracy.

### Visual Fidelity
- Line fade effect (6M→12M) uses CSS gradients - verify on older browsers
- Uncertainty cone bezier curves - ensure smooth on all devices
- Multiple overlapping paths in sector chart - test on low-end devices

---

## Testing Tools

### Browser DevTools
```bash
# Chrome DevTools Device Emulation
Cmd+Shift+M (Mac) / Ctrl+Shift+M (Windows)

# Responsive Design Mode
- Toggle device toolbar
- Test various presets
- Custom dimensions
```

### Real Device Testing
- Use actual phones/tablets when possible
- Test touch interactions
- Verify rendering on real hardware

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Run Lighthouse audit
npm run lighthouse

# Check responsive breakpoints
npm run test:responsive
```

## Sign-off

- [ ] All critical breakpoints tested
- [ ] Charts render correctly on all devices
- [ ] No layout breaks or horizontal scroll
- [ ] Interactive elements work on touch devices
- [ ] Performance acceptable on low-end devices
