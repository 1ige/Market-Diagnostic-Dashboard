Seed Indicators Script
----------------------
Creates all 11 indicator metadata entries in the database.
This script is automatically run on container startup via startup.sh.

Indicators:
- VIX: Volatility stress indicator (high = stress)
- SPY: S&P 500 ETF momentum (stores EMA gap %, below EMA = stress)
- DFF: Federal Funds Rate (stores absolute rate, scores based on rate-of-change)
- T10Y2Y: Treasury yield curve (inverted = stress)
- UNRATE: Unemployment rate (high = stress)
- CONSUMER_HEALTH: Derived from PCE, CPI, and PI (low = stress)
- BOND_MARKET_STABILITY: Derived from 10Y and 30Y volatility (high = stress)
- LIQUIDITY_PROXY: EFFR volatility (high = stress)
- ANALYST_ANXIETY: Composite sentiment indicator from VIX, MOVE, HY OAS, ERP (high = stress)
- SENTIMENT_COMPOSITE: Consumer & corporate confidence from Michigan, NFIB, ISM, CapEx
- AAP: Alternative Asset Pressure from crypto and precious metals (low = pressure/distrust)

Real data will be fetched automatically by the ETL scheduler every 4 hours.
